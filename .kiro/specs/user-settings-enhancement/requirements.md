# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current user settings system has a comprehensive UserProfile component with tabs for API Settings, Preferences, and Personal Info, but there are several critical issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Tab Order Issues**: The current tab implementation has incorrect ordering and navigation
2. **Settings Persistence**: User settings are not properly applied across all components and pages after login
3. **Appearance Settings**: Theme and appearance settings are not immediately applied after login
4. **MDM Products Grid**: Issues with the MDM products grid functionality and integration
5. **Base Components**: Need tuning and fixes for better performance and consistency
6. **Magento Grid Integration**: Issues with Magento grid components and data handling

This enhancement will fix these issues and create a robust, persistent user settings system that works seamlessly across the entire application.
