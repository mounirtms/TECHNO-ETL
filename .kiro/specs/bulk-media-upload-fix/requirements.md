# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The bulk media upload functionality currently has critical issues with image matching that result in only one match being found when multiple matches should be detected. Additionally, the system has unnecessary complexity with professional/basic mode switching that should be simplified to use only advanced matching with configurable settings. The system needs to be streamlined and optimized according to the project's performance standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to upload CSV files with product data and match them with image files using advanced matching algorithms, so that I can efficiently associate multiple images with their corresponding products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a CSV file with product SKUs THEN the system SHALL parse the file and detect all valid product entries
2. WHEN I upload image files THEN the system SHALL validate each file and accept multiple images per product
3. WHEN the matching process runs THEN the system SHALL find ALL possible matches using advanced algorithms, not just one match
4. WHEN multiple images match a single SKU THEN the system SHALL support multiple images per product with proper indexing (_1, _2, _3 patterns)
5. WHEN the matching is complete THEN the system SHALL display accurate statistics showing total matches found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simplified interface with only advanced matching capabilities, so that I don't have to choose between confusing professional and basic modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the bulk upload dialog THEN the system SHALL show only one unified interface without mode selection
2. WHEN I configure matching settings THEN the system SHALL provide advanced options including exact, fuzzy, and normalized matching strategies
3. WHEN the system processes files THEN it SHALL automatically use the most appropriate matching strategies based on the data
4. IF a REF column exists in the CSV THEN the system SHALL automatically include REF-based matching without requiring mode switching

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bulk upload functionality to follow the project's performance and optimization standards, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component loads THEN it SHALL use optimized React patterns with proper memoization
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI with progress indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN the upload completes THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary resources and provide comprehensive results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code with proper error handling and documentation, so that the system is easy to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN it SHALL follow the project's coding standards and patterns
2. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the user experience
3. WHEN the matching logic runs THEN it SHALL be properly documented and testable
4. WHEN unnecessary files exist THEN they SHALL be removed to maintain a clean codebase
