# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix core matching algorithm to find ALL matches instead of just one





  - Analyze and fix the matching logic in `findMatchingImages` method that currently breaks after first match
  - Remove the `break` statement that stops after finding one match when `multipleImages` is disabled
  - Ensure all matching strategies run for all images and return complete results
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Remove professional/basic mode complexity and consolidate to unified advanced matching










  - Remove mode selection UI components and state management from BulkMediaUploadDialog
  - Remove `detectMode` function and mode-based conditional logic
  - Consolidate matching strategies to always use advanced algorithms
  - Update UI to show single unified interface without mode chips or selection
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
-

- [x] 3. Fix TypeScript syntax errors and component structure issues




  - Fix malformed JSX syntax with incorrect `sx` prop usage and duplicate properties
  - Correct TypeScript type annotations and interface definitions
  - Fix broken component prop spreading and conditional rendering
  - Resolve import statement issues and dependency references
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_
-
- [x] 4. Consolidate and optimize the media upload service files

- [x] 4. Consolidate and optimize the media upload service files



  - Merge functionality from `mediaUploadService.js` and `mediaUploadServiceOptimized.js`
  - Create single optimized service with all advanced matching capabilities
  - Remove duplicate code and consolidate matching algorithms
  - Update import references throughout the codebase
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_
-

- [-] 5. Enhance matching algorithm accuracy and performance





  - Improve fuzzy matching algorithm to handle edge cases and special characters
  - Add support for numbered image patterns (_1, _2, _3) with proper indexing
  - Optimize string normalization and similarity calculation functions
  - Add configurable matching thresholds and strategy weights
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.2_

- [ ] 6. Implement automatic CSV structure detection without mode switching

  - Create unified CSV parser that automatically detects column types
  - Remove mode parameter from `parseCSVFile` method
  - Add automatic REF column detection and utilization
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing CSV formats
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Fix UI components and improve user experience




  - Remove mode selection components and simplify dialog header
  - Fix settings panel to always show advanced options
  - Improve progress indicators and result display components
  - Add better error messaging and validation feedback
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.3, 4.2_


- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and validation


  - Implement proper error boundaries for upload process
  - Add validation for CSV structure and image file formats
  - Create graceful fallback mechanisms for matching failures
  - Add detailed error reporting with actionable suggestions
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Optimize performance for large datasets
  - Implement batch processing for large CSV files and image collections
  - Add memory management for file processing operations
  - Optimize UI rendering during heavy processing operations
  - Add progress tracking and cancellation capabilities
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 10. Clean up codebase and remove unnecessary files
  - Remove unused professional mode related code and components
  - Delete redundant service files and consolidate functionality
  - Clean up import statements and remove dead code
  - Update documentation and comments to reflect simplified architecture
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [ ] 11. Create comprehensive unit tests for matching algorithms
  - Write tests for each matching strategy (exact, normalized, fuzzy, REF)
  - Test edge cases with special characters, numbers, and multiple images
  - Validate CSV parsing with various file formats and structures
  - Test error handling scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 4.3_

- [ ] 12. Integration testing and end-to-end validation
  - Test complete upload workflow with real CSV and image files
  - Validate matching accuracy with different product naming conventions
  - Test performance with large datasets (100+ products, 500+ images)
  - Verify UI responsiveness and error handling in production scenarios
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
