# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses advanced layout and UI improvements for the Techno-ETL application, focusing on enhanced tab functionality, responsive sidebar behavior, RTL language support, and performance optimizations. The goal is to create a polished, accessible, and performant user interface that adapts seamlessly to different languages and screen sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want tab titles to be fully displayed and manageable, so that I can easily identify and navigate between different sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tab titles are long THEN they SHALL be displayed with proper truncation and tooltips showing full text
2. WHEN hovering over truncated tab titles THEN the full title SHALL be visible in a tooltip
3. WHEN tabs exceed available width THEN they SHALL provide horizontal scrolling or overflow handling
4. WHEN tab content changes THEN the title SHALL update dynamically to reflect current state
5. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN each tab SHALL have a distinct and readable title

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to close tabs individually, so that I can manage my workspace efficiently and reduce clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tab is displayed THEN it SHALL include a close button (X icon)
2. WHEN clicking the close button THEN the tab SHALL be removed from the interface
3. WHEN closing a tab with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
4. WHEN the last tab is closed THEN the system SHALL either show a default view or prevent closure
5. WHEN closing tabs THEN keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+W) SHALL be supported
6. WHEN hovering over the close button THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the entire layout to respond to sidebar collapse/expand, so that I can maximize my workspace when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar collapses THEN the header SHALL expand to fill the available width
2. WHEN the sidebar collapses THEN the main content area SHALL expand accordingly
3. WHEN the sidebar collapses THEN the footer SHALL adjust its width to match the new layout
4. WHEN the sidebar collapses THEN the tab container SHALL resize to utilize the additional space
5. WHEN the sidebar expands THEN all layout elements SHALL smoothly transition back to their original positions
6. WHEN sidebar state changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and performant (under 300ms)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who reads right-to-left languages, I want the interface to properly support RTL layout, so that the application is accessible and intuitive in my language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RTL mode is enabled THEN the sidebar SHALL appear on the right side of the screen
2. WHEN RTL mode is enabled THEN tab navigation SHALL flow from right to left
3. WHEN RTL mode is enabled THEN text alignment SHALL be right-aligned where appropriate
4. WHEN RTL mode is enabled THEN icons and UI elements SHALL be mirrored appropriately
5. WHEN RTL mode is enabled THEN the close buttons on tabs SHALL appear on the left side of each tab
6. WHEN switching between LTR and RTL THEN the layout SHALL transition smoothly without breaking
7. WHEN RTL mode is enabled THEN all tooltips and dropdowns SHALL position correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be performant and responsive, so that I can work efficiently without delays or visual glitches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with tabs THEN the response time SHALL be under 100ms
2. WHEN the sidebar toggles THEN the animation SHALL be smooth at 60fps
3. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN the layout SHALL adapt without flickering
4. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN the interface SHALL maintain performance
5. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the transition SHALL be instantaneous
6. WHEN the application loads THEN the layout SHALL render progressively without layout shifts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced styling and visual polish, so that the application feels modern and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tabs THEN they SHALL have consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
2. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN it SHALL show appropriate icons or minimal indicators
4. WHEN viewing the interface THEN colors, shadows, and borders SHALL follow a consistent design system
5. WHEN elements are focused THEN they SHALL have clear accessibility indicators
6. WHEN the interface is viewed on different screen sizes THEN it SHALL maintain visual consistency
