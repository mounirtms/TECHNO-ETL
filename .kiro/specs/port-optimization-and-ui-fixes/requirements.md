# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical optimization and error fixes for the Techno-ETL application, focusing on port configuration standardization, service routing optimization, and resolving React UI component errors. The goal is to establish a consistent development environment with frontend on port 80, backend on port 5000, proper service routing, and fix Material-UI Tooltip component errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized port configuration across all services, so that the development environment is consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend application starts THEN it SHALL run on port 80
2. WHEN the backend application starts THEN it SHALL run on port 5000
3. WHEN any service needs to communicate with the backend THEN it SHALL use localhost:5000 as the base URL
4. IF a service is Magento-related THEN it SHALL use unified service if set direct on settings will use direct otherwise will use default backend URLs from settings configuration
5. WHEN configuration files are updated THEN they SHALL reflect the standardized port assignments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dashboard and non-Magento services to route through the backend API, so that there is a centralized communication pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard services make API calls THEN they SHALL route through localhost:5000
2. WHEN non-Magento services need backend communication THEN they SHALL use the centralized backend endpoint
3. IF a service is Magento-specific THEN it SHALL be allowed to use direct URL configuration from settings
4. WHEN service routing is configured THEN it SHALL be documented and consistent across the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI components to render without console errors, so that the application provides a clean user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Tooltip component wraps a disabled button THEN it SHALL include a wrapper element (span) around the disabled button
2. WHEN the UnifiedGridToolbar renders THEN it SHALL not produce Tooltip-related errors
3. WHEN the ProductManagementGrid renders THEN it SHALL not produce Tooltip-related errors
4. WHEN any disabled interactive element is wrapped in a Tooltip THEN it SHALL have proper wrapper elements to handle events
5. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN it SHALL not display Material-UI component warnings in the console

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build and deployment processes, so that both frontend and backend work seamlessly in development mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development environment starts THEN both frontend and backend SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN build processes run THEN they SHALL complete without errors
3. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use the optimized routing configuration
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain the port and routing configurations
5. WHEN components are developed THEN they SHALL follow DRY principles with reusable base components
