# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current project architecture has several critical flaws including duplicated code, conflicting usage patterns, inconsistent navigation behavior, and fragmented permission systems. This comprehensive refactoring will establish a clean, scalable architecture with proper user licensing, permissions management, consistent tab-based navigation, unified API integration patterns, and streamlined product management tools.

The refactoring addresses:
1. **Sidebar Menu & Licensing**: Implement per-user licensing with granular permissions
2. **Tab Panel Navigation**: Ensure all pages open consistently in tab panels
3. **Router Optimization**: Perfect the existing routing system
4. **API Integration**: Standardize MDM endpoints usage vs Magento REST API
5. **Product Management**: Create comprehensive catalog and category management tools
6. **User Profile**: Add MDM, Magento, and Cegid configuration settings
7. **Architecture Cleanup**: Remove duplications and conflicts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Licensing and Permissions System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user licenses and permissions through the sidebar menu, so that I can control access to features based on user roles and subscription levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL check their license level and display only permitted menu items
2. WHEN an admin manages licenses THEN they SHALL be able to assign/revoke permissions per user
3. WHEN a user accesses a restricted feature THEN the system SHALL show appropriate permission denied messages
4. WHEN permissions change THEN the sidebar menu SHALL update dynamically without requiring logout
5. IF a user's license expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and notify the user

### Requirement 2: Consistent Tab Panel Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application pages to open consistently within the tab panel system, so that I have a unified navigation experience with the dashboard as the default tab.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to any page THEN it SHALL open within the tab panel, not overlay it
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the dashboard SHALL be the default active tab
3. WHEN I open multiple pages THEN they SHALL appear as separate tabs in the tab panel
4. WHEN I close tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper tab state and navigation history
5. WHEN dashboard loads THEN it SHALL respect user permissions for displaying widgets and data

### Requirement 3: Router System Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a perfected routing system that handles all navigation scenarios consistently, so that the application provides reliable navigation behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routes are defined THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and naming conventions
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN it SHALL properly integrate with the tab panel system
3. WHEN deep linking is used THEN it SHALL open the correct page in the appropriate tab
4. WHEN route guards are needed THEN they SHALL check permissions before allowing access
5. WHEN routing errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with proper fallbacks

### Requirement 4: Unified API Integration Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between MDM endpoints and Magento REST API usage, so that data flows are predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard components need data THEN they SHALL use MDM endpoints exclusively
2. WHEN product grids in dashboard context are used THEN they SHALL use MDM endpoints like other dashboard components
3. WHEN CMS pages, orders, and attributes are accessed THEN they SHALL use Magento REST API
4. WHEN product management features are used THEN they SHALL use appropriate API based on context (MDM for dashboard, Magento for management)
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Product Management System

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want comprehensive tools for managing product catalogs, attributes, and categories, so that I can efficiently organize and maintain product data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access product catalog management THEN I SHALL see tools for managing products, attributes, and categories
2. WHEN I manage categories THEN I SHALL be able to create, edit, delete, and organize category hierarchies
3. WHEN I work with products THEN I SHALL be able to move products between categories and remove them from categories
4. WHEN I manage attributes THEN I SHALL be able to create, modify, and assign attributes to products
5. WHEN I perform bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide efficient tools for mass product management

### Requirement 6: Enhanced User Profile Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive configuration options in my profile for MDM, Magento, and Cegid connections, so that I can configure direct API access when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access user profile settings THEN I SHALL see configuration sections for MDM, Magento, and Cegid
2. WHEN I configure Magento direct connection THEN the frontend SHALL be able to bypass the backend for Magento services
3. WHEN I set up Cegid connection THEN the system SHALL validate and store connection parameters
4. WHEN I enable direct connections THEN the system SHALL respect these settings even when frontend is hosted without backend
5. WHEN connection settings change THEN dependent services SHALL update their API routing accordingly

### Requirement 7: Architecture Cleanup and Deduplication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean architecture without code duplication and usage conflicts, so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are reviewed THEN duplicate code SHALL be identified and consolidated into reusable components
2. WHEN conflicting usage patterns are found THEN they SHALL be standardized to follow consistent patterns
3. WHEN services are refactored THEN they SHALL follow single responsibility principle
4. WHEN utilities are created THEN they SHALL be properly organized and documented
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the codebase SHALL have clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 8: Permission-Based Feature Access

**User Story:** As a user, I want different permission levels for various operations (view, edit, delete, add), so that my access is appropriately controlled based on my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access any page THEN the system SHALL show only the operations I'm permitted to perform
2. WHEN I have view-only permissions THEN edit, delete, and add buttons SHALL be hidden or disabled
3. WHEN I have edit permissions THEN I SHALL be able to modify existing records but not delete them
4. WHEN I have full permissions THEN I SHALL be able to perform all CRUD operations
5. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about required permission levels

### Requirement 9: Flexible Backend Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the frontend to work with or without the custom backend, so that deployment flexibility is maintained while ensuring Magento services remain accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend is deployed without backend THEN Magento services SHALL still be accessible through direct API calls
2. WHEN backend is available THEN the system SHALL use it for enhanced features and caching
3. WHEN direct Magento connection is configured THEN the system SHALL bypass backend for Magento-specific operations
4. WHEN backend becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to direct API connections where configured
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL adapt API routing without requiring application restart

### Requirement 10: Improved Category Management Tools

**User Story:** As a catalog manager, I want advanced category management tools that allow me to efficiently organize products and manage category hierarchies, so that the product catalog is well-structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access category management THEN I SHALL see a hierarchical tree view of all categories
2. WHEN I drag and drop products THEN they SHALL be moved between categories with proper validation
3. WHEN I create new categories THEN I SHALL be able to set parent-child relationships and category attributes
4. WHEN I delete categories THEN the system SHALL handle product reassignment or provide options for orphaned products
5. WHEN I perform bulk category operations THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and error handling
