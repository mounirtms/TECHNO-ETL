now lets go the userProfile setting tab ,
need to add magento api url and username and password and a button to get a token ,same way will have a field for cefgid url and cegid username and password and database fields .
and also a button to save all this in firebase real time database .
we will have tables and grids that uses cegid SOAP requests to populate data . 
apply a mechanism like we have for magento . 
and we will have stocks and sources grid with both cegid view and magento view . 
all grids ashould inherit the base grid .
we will add a base components also for all the tab views . 
the date range component  and a refresh button and use cegid or magento api to get the data options .
and for now this will be the base toolbar component and will be on all the tabs so should be added to TabPanel.
