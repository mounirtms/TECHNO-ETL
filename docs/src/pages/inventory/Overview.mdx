# Magento Inventory Management

## Overview

Magento's Multi-Source Inventory (MSI) system allows you to manage inventory from multiple physical locations. This guide explains the key concepts and how to use them effectively.

## Key Concepts

### Sources
Sources represent physical locations where your product inventory is stored and managed:
- Warehouses
- Brick-and-mortar stores
- Distribution centers
- Drop shippers

Each source has:
- Unique identifier (source_code)
- Name and description
- Contact information
- Address details
- Priority (for shipping)

### Stocks
Stocks link your sources to sales channels:
- Group multiple sources together
- Associate with specific sales channels (websites)
- Define source priority for shipping
- Automatically calculate available quantity

### Source Items
Source Items track the inventory for each product at each source:
- Product SKU
- Source code
- Quantity
- Status (in stock/out of stock)

## Managing Inventory

### Sources Management
1. View all sources in the Sources grid
2. Create new sources for each physical location
3. Enable/disable sources as needed
4. Set source priority for fulfillment

### Stock Management
1. Create stocks to group sources
2. Assign stocks to websites
3. Set source priority within stocks
4. View stock levels across sources

### Source Items
1. Assign products to sources
2. Update quantities per source
3. Enable/disable products per source
4. Transfer inventory between sources

## Best Practices

1. **Source Setup**
   - Create sources for all physical locations
   - Set accurate address information
   - Define contact details for each source
   - Set appropriate priorities

2. **Stock Configuration**
   - Create separate stocks for different regions
   - Assign appropriate sources to each stock
   - Link stocks to correct sales channels
   - Review source priorities regularly

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Keep source quantities updated
   - Monitor stock levels across sources
   - Use source priority for efficient fulfillment
   - Regular inventory reconciliation

## API Integration

### Endpoints

```javascript
// Get all sources
GET /rest/V1/inventory/sources

// Get specific source
GET /rest/V1/inventory/sources/{sourceCode}

// Get stocks
GET /rest/V1/inventory/stocks

// Get source items
GET /rest/V1/inventory/source-items
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Fetch sources
const sources = await magentoApi.getSources({
    pageSize: 20,
    currentPage: 1
});

// Fetch stocks
const stocks = await magentoApi.getStocks({
    pageSize: 20,
    currentPage: 1
});

// Fetch source items
const sourceItems = await magentoApi.getSourceItems({
    pageSize: 20,
    currentPage: 1
});
```
