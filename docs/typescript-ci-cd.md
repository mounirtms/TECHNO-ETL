# TypeScript CI/CD Integration

This document describes how TypeScript type checking is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for the Techno-ETL project.

## Overview

We have set up automated TypeScript type checking to run on every push to main branches and on pull requests. This helps catch type errors early in the development process and prevents them from making it to production.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. TypeScript Type Checking Workflow

File: `.github/workflows/typescript-checks.yml`

This workflow runs on:
- Pushes to main, master, and develop branches
- Pull requests to these branches

It performs these steps:
- Checks out the code
- Sets up Node.js
- Installs dependencies
- Runs TypeScript type checking with detailed diagnostics
- If errors are found, it generates and uploads error reports as artifacts

### 2. TypeScript PR Check Workflow

File: `.github/workflows/typescript-pr-check.yml`

This workflow is specifically for pull requests and adds inline code annotations:
- Runs on pull requests to main branches when TypeScript files change
- Checks out the code and runs type checking
- Generates GitHub annotations for any TypeScript errors found
- Creates a summary of error types found in the PR

## Local Development

You can run the same type checks locally using these npm scripts:

```bash
# Basic type checking
npm run type-check

# Continuous type checking during development
npm run type-check:watch

# Detailed diagnostics (same as CI/CD)
npm run type-check:detailed

# Generate error reports (same format as CI/CD)
npm run type-check:ci
```

## Error Reports

When the CI/CD process finds TypeScript errors, it generates two types of artifacts:
1. `typescript-error-report.json` - A JSON file containing detailed error information
2. `typescript-error-summary.md` - A Markdown file summarizing the errors

For pull requests, errors are also shown as inline annotations in the GitHub PR interface.

## Integration with Build Process

The production build process (`npm run build`) automatically runs TypeScript checks before building. If type errors are found, the build will fail.

For quick development builds that skip type checking, you can use:
```bash
npm run build:fast
```

## Handling CI/CD Failures

If the CI/CD process fails due to TypeScript errors:

1. Download the error report artifacts from the GitHub Actions page
2. Review the `typescript-error-summary.md` file for an overview of errors
3. Fix the errors in your codebase
4. Re-run the type checks locally using `npm run type-check`
5. Push your fixes and check that the CI/CD process passes
